This project explores two aims:

1. to what extent, the according penguin species can be predicted based on individual penguin-features
2. which features are most important for this prediction

The first aim will be investigated by typical Machine Learning-methods and the second aim by models based on inferential statistics. For all codes the language R and corresponding libraries.

Data comes from real world conditions collected by biologists: Palmer Penguins-Dataset (links below).

1. Identifing problems and data understanding
2. Data mining
3. Data cleaning
4. Data exploration
5. feature engeneeing
6. Predictive Modeling
7. Data visualization
